      "The critical function of NFAT proteins in maintaining lymphoid homeostasis was revealed in mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT4 ( DKO ) .\n",
      "DKO mice exhibit increased lymphoproliferation , decreased activation-induced cell death , and impaired induction of FasL .\n",
      "The transcription factors Egr2 and Egr3 are potent activators of FasL expression .\n",
      "Here we find that Egr2 and Egr3 are NFAT target genes .\n",
      "Activation of FasL occurs via the NFAT -dependent induction of Egr3 , as demonstrated by the ability of exogenously provided NFATp to restore Egr -dependent FasL promoter activity in DKO lymph node cells .\n",
      "Further , Egr3 expression is enriched in Th1 cells , suggesting a molecular basis for the known preferential expression of FasL in the Th1 versus Th2 subset .\n",

      "MATERIALS AND METHODS : We screened a panel of acute myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines for TNF- alpha -responsiveness .\n",
      "In two lines ( OCI-AML-1 , OCI-AML-11 ) , TNF- alpha acted as an apoptotic agent ; in others ( HU-3 , M-07e , TF-1 ) , it had the opposite effect , preventing apoptosis and inducing proliferation .\n",
      "Direct and indirect signaling mechanisms , including NF-kappaB activation and cytokine synthesis , were analyzed .\n",
      "RESULTS : All cell lines tested expressed TNF- alpha receptors I and II and responded to TNF- alpha by upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 .\n",
      "In contrast to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , TNF- alpha did not activate the MAP kinase and p70S6 kinase pathways .\n",

      "Supporting this notion , TNF-alpha -induced upregulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels and protein secretion in the TNF-alpha -proliferative , but not in the TNF-alpha-apoptotic cell lines .\n",

      "We show for the first time that TNF-alpha-treated cell lines producing no or only minimal amounts of GM-CSF demonstrate an apoptotic phenotype , while cell lines with high GM-CSF expression rates can escape from growth arrest or even apoptosis .\n",

      "fNF-E2 mRNA was found to be more abundant in erythroid cells than megakaryocytic cells at day 7 of culture .\n",
      "Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid-megakaryocytic cell lines , megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF-E2 , suggesting that fNF-E2 promoter is more erythroid specific .\n",
      "Functional analysis of fNF-E2 promoter showed that the promoter is active only in erythroid-megakaryocytic cells and that the double GATA sit e in the proximal region is necessary for its efficient activity .\n",

      "Hence , the diploid state of the genome offers the advantage that a loss-of-function mutation in one allele can be compensated for by the remaining wild-type allele of the same gene .\n",
      "Indeed , the vast majority of human disease syndromes and engineered mutations in the mouse genome are recessive , indicating that recessiveness is the 'default ' state .\n",
      "However , a minority of genes are semi-dominant , as heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in these genes leads to phenotypic abnormalities .\n",
      "This condition , known as haploinsufficiency , has been described for five of the nine mammalian Pax genes , which are associated with mouse developmental mutants and human disease syndromes .\n",
      "Recently we have reported that the Pax5 gene is subject to allele -specific regulation during B cell development .\n",
      "Pax5 is predominantly transcribed from only one of its two alleles in early B-lymphoid progenitors and mature B cells , while it transiently switches to a biallelic mode of transcription in pre-B and immature B cells .\n",
      "As a consequence , B-lymphoid tissues are mosaic with regard to the transcribed allele , and heterozygous mutation of Pax5 therefore results in deletion of B lymphocytes expressing only the mutant allele .\n",
      "The allele -specific regulation of Pax5 raises the intriguing possibility that monoallelic expression may also be the mechanism causing the haploinsufficiency of other Pax genes .\n",
      "In this review , we discuss different models accounting for the haploinsufficiency of mammalian Pax genes , provide further evidence in support of the allele -specific regulation of Pax5 and discuss the implication of these findings in the context of the recent literature describing the stochastic and monoallelic activation of other hematopoietic genes .\n",
